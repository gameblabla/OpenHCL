# OpenHCL (Hydra Castle Labyrinth) Gamecube port 0.1 alpha build
GC port by gameblabla

This is based upon the Wii's code, i just adapted it for the Gamecube.
It works good so far and it is playable.

This supports loading files from the SD Gecko (both slots), SD2SP2 and GC Loader/DVD.
Make sure to put the assets in apps/OpenHCL to run the game.

# Changelog

1.0
Music support.
Works fine now 

# Rooms for improvement

- Memory card support (Saves to SD card for now)
- 480i/480p support (But i'm afraid we would run out of memory so i disabled them)
